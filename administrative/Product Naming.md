Why **Crossroads**?

Crossroads is a place where people come from many directions and meet. Reaching a crossroad also means, one reaches a point where he/she needs to make some decision and potentially needs some help. Harvard Summer school is such a junction point of the crossroads where students come from many diffrent parts of the world. Some of them or their parents don't know what to expect, what they can do before or after coming here to make their/their childrens' campus and school experience better. This product will help them to make that decision from the experience of past and other current students. There may be other products in the market which do this to a certain degree but there are not any (or at least not many) which do this in a comprehensive way or do this by sharing the actual experience of past or other current students. Our product is unique in that nature  students for students.
