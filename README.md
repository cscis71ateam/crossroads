You can find our project here: http://harvard.crossroads.guru

## Project Part4
1. **Sprint Forecast**
<br/>Sprint Goal: Implementing edit, delete and formatting features

<br/>Based on a Yesterday’s Weather forecast, we have forecasted 34 story points for Sprint 2. We had 34 story points done in Sprint 2. Therefore, the Development Team and the Product Owner decided to forecast 34 story points, which is the same forecast as previous sprint.

2. **Sprint Backlog**
<br/>We pulled stories into our sprint backlog. Only Development Team members participated in this activity.
<br/>We decided on the following sprint backlog:
* Edit a Blog Post - estimated to 13 story points
* Delete a Blog Post - estimated to 8 story points
* Format Blog Post into Multi Paragraphs - estimated to 13 story points

<br/>In total a sprint backlog estimated to 34 story points.

3. **Our stories were not larger than half the size of the forecast.** 
<br/>Please, refer to #2.


4. **Task Backlog**
<br/>In Trello, we added a checklist to all Product Backlog items called tasks, where tasks are tracked.

6. **Burndown Chart**
<br/><br/>![Burndown Chart Sprint 3](https://github.com/cscis71ateam/crossroads/blob/master/media/Crossroads%20Burndown%20for%20Sprint%203.png)

<br/>In Sprint 3, only 18 story points were done and the PBI ‘Format Blog Post in Multiple Paragraphs’ was not done - a story estimated to 13 story points. We had impediments from last sprint in getting CI/CD running. Furthermore, we implemented a BDD test, which was an impediment to reaching our sprint goal, since it consumed more focus than expected dragging us away from the formatting story. 

7. **Daily Scrum**

**July 11, 2018** 
<br/>We held a physical Daily Scrum at 10 am time-boxed to 15 minutes, facilitated by our Scrum Master, Simon.

**Updates since previous parts:**
<br/>Based on the feedback received after the last sprint, we adapted the following parts: 
* Updated Trello board with new columns for previous sprint to make it easy to distinguish the historical records
* Updated burndown chart to show “Forecast” rather than “estimated”


## Project Part3:
1. **Forecast**
<br/>**Sprint Goal:** Implementing blog features and information page on Crossroads.

</br>Based on a Yesterday’s Weather forecast, we have forecasted 34 story points for Sprint 2. We had 32 story points done in Sprint 1, however we had to change framework after one day which set the progress way behind. Therefore, the Development Team and the Product Owner decided to forecast 34 story points, which is a slight increase.

2. **Sprint Backlog**
<br/>We pulled stories into our sprint backlog. Only Development Team members participated in this activity.
<br/>We decided on the following sprint backlog:
* Information Page with Links - estimated to 8 story points
* Write Blog Post - estimated to 13 story points
* Viewing a Blog Post - estimated to 13 story points

<br/>In total a sprint backlog estimated to 34 story points.


3. **Our stories were not larger than half the size of the forecast.** 
<br/>Please, refer to #2.

4. In Trello, we added a checklist to all Product Backlog items called tasks, where tasks are tracked.

6. **Sprint Burndown Chart**
<br/>![Sprint review](https://github.com/cscis71ateam/crossroads/blob/master/media/Sprint%202%20Burndown%20Picture.png)
<br/>In Sprint 2, our actual burndown is close to the ideal burndown. After Sprint 1, we adapted our refinement process by breaking down the PBIs into smaller and easily shippable items. Furthermore, we had an extra day in the sprint and the basic infrastructure were already in place, which gave the Development Team more time to focus on delivering actual value to the users.

7. **Daily Scrum**
**July 7, 2018**
We held a physical Daily Scrum at 10 am time-boxed to 15 minutes, facilitated by our Scrum Master, Simon.

<br/>![Sprint review](https://github.com/cscis71ateam/crossroads/blob/master/media/Sprint%202%20Sprint%20Review%20Pic%201.png)

**Feedbacks from stakeholder Linh**
* Search Function, search for keyword
* Search is more important than cover photo in blog posts
* Board Plus information
* The blog is still very important because it’s real opinion
* Users need more information rather than only positive words
* Refer to mitadmission.org

**Adapt:**
<br/>As an output of the Sprint Review, our Product Owner, Chun, reordered the backlog to have “Searching for a Keyword” and “Edit a Blog Post” to the top of the backlog. 

<br/>We also created two new PBIs that need to be refined:
* View User Persona on the Author
* Add a Photo to Blog Post

11. **You have a Continuous Integration**
<br/>We have set up the Continuous Integration by utilizing CircleCI, however we have issues in executing the tests. This is a impediment towards reaching our sprint goal.
<br/>![CI error](https://github.com/cscis71ateam/crossroads/blob/master/media/Sprint%202%20Circle%20CI%20Status%20Pic%201.png)


12. **Continuous Deployment** 
<br/>This is one of our impediments. We are having some challenges in settng it up for our current deployment environment<br/>


**Update to previous parts:**
<br/>Based on the feedback received after the last sprint, we adapted the following parts: 
* Updated user stories to focus on a specific stakeholder type - see Trello board for more detail
* Updated far vision to: “Our far vision is to build a community that answers all questions a prospective student might have before arriving at the campus; no matter which university, nationality or current residency.”
* Adapted ordering criteria to:
    * Dependency
    * Most valuable to the user
    * Complexity
* Grouped unit tests into larger test files
* Ensuring that we have working software


## Project Part2:

1. **Forecast**
<br/>We forecasted to have 33 story points done by the first sprint. 
Sprint Goal: To have a landing page where the users can see what content is available on the site.

2. **The rationale for our forecast.** 
<br/>Since this our first sprint we did not have any data to follow a forecasting pattern like “Yesterday’s Weather”, so we made our estimation based on the task involved and our experience about the product and development tools & technologies we are using to develop the functionalities and how much time it can take.
	
3. **Sprint Planning**
<br/>We pulled stories into our sprint backlog. Only Development Team members participated in this activity.
	Initially, the Development Team members agreed to pull the following two items into the Sprint:
* Landing page - estimated to 20 story points
* Menu Items - estimated to 13 story point

Since the “Landings Page” story was too large with an estimate of 20 story points. We decided to refine “Landing page” by breaking it into these smaller stories and re-estimated the smaller stories using Planning Poker and ended with the following final Sprint Backlog:
* Landing Page Layout - estimated to 13 story points
* Landing Page Background - estimated to 3 story points
* Landing Page Welcome Message - estimated to 3 story points
* Menu Items - estimated to 13 story points

4. **Our stories were not larger than half the size of the forecast.**
<br/>Refer to #3

5. **You decomposed stories into tasks. The tasks are clearly listed in your sprint backlog.**
<br/>In Trello, we added a checklist to all Product Backlog items called tasks, where tasks are tracked.

**The whole Scrum Team**
* *What did we do yesterday?*
Yesterday we did Sprint Planning and Backlog refinement so that we could have our PBIs meeting our Definition of Ready.

After talking to Richard, we decided to change framework from Drupal to node.js/express as the main framework.

**Mo** 
* *What did you do yesterday?*
Did some research and installed the node.js and express framework. Prepared the development and deployed environment for both local development and remote production servers. Put some additional details and tasks on the Landing Page PBI.

* *What are you gonna do today?*
Build infrastructure and start implementing the user story landing page.

* *What are your impediments?*
Since we decided to change the framework, we all have to install new components. Mo’s removal plan is to make some readjustment to our Sprint Backlog together with the rest of the Development Team and Product Owner after the Daily Scrum. 

**Anna** 
* *What did you do yesterday?*
Helped with organizing the Sprint Backlog. Looked for images for the landing page. 

* *What are you gonna do today?*
Install new software and learn about the Node.js framework. Sit together with Mo to understand the infrastructure. 

* *Impediment*
Doesn’t know node.js, so she has to learn the new framework.  To remove this impediment, Anna will be doing mob programming with the Development Team.

**Chun**
* *What did you do yesterday?*
Did research about node.js

* *What are you gonna do today?*
Install new software and learn about the Node.js framework. Sit together with Mo to understand the infrastructure. 

* *Impediments*
Doesn’t know node.js, so he has to learn the new framework. However, he has experience with Django and know how to research more. To remove this impediment, Chun will be doing mob programming with the Development Team.

**Simon**
* *What did you do yesterday?*
Researched on the node.js framework and set up the framework on his machine

* *What are you gonna do today?*
Install new software and learn about the Node.js framework. Sit together with Mo to understand the infrastructure. 

* *Impediment*
Doesn’t know node.js, so he has to learn the new framework. To remove this impediment, Simon will research on the framework and do mob programming with the Development Team.

**General**
* *How do we remove impediments?*
The Development Team decided together with the Product Owner to break down the user stories into smaller items in order to lower the complexity and follow the INVEST principle.

Since the “Landings Page” story was too large with an estimate of 20 story points. We decided to refine “Landing page” by breaking it into these smaller stories and re-estimated the smaller stories using Planning Poker and ended with the following final Sprint Backlog:
* Landing Page Layout - estimated to 13 story points
* Landing Page Background - estimated to 3 story points
* Landing Page Welcome Message - estimated to 3 story points
* Menu Items - estimated to 13 story points

4. **Our stories were not larger than half the size of the forecast.**
<br/>Refer to #3

5. **You decomposed stories into tasks. The tasks are clearly listed in your sprint backlog.**
<br/>In Trello, we added a checklist to all Product Backlog items called tasks, where tasks are tracked.

**The whole Scrum Team**
* *What did we do yesterday?*
Yesterday we did Sprint Planning and Backlog refinement so that we could have our PBIs meeting our Definition of Ready.

After talking to Richard, we decided to change framework from Drupal to node.js/express as the main framework.

**Mo** 
* *What did you do yesterday?*
Did some research and installed the node.js and express framework. Prepared the development and deployed environment for both local development and remote production servers. Put some additional details and tasks on the Landing Page PBI.

* *What are you gonna do today?*
Build infrastructure and start implementing the user story landing page.

* *What are your impediments?*
Since we decided to change the framework, we all have to install new components. Mo’s removal plan is to make some readjustment to our Sprint Backlog together with the rest of the Development Team and Product Owner after the Daily Scrum. 

**Anna** 
* *What did you do yesterday?*
Helped with organizing the Sprint Backlog. Looked for images for the landing page. 

* *What are you gonna do today?*
Install new software and learn about the Node.js framework. Sit together with Mo to understand the infrastructure. 

* *Impediment*
Doesn’t know node.js, so she has to learn the new framework.  To remove this impediment, Anna will be doing mob programming with the Development Team.

**Chun**
* *What did you do yesterday?*
Did research about node.js

* *What are you gonna do today?*
Install new software and learn about the Node.js framework. Sit together with Mo to understand the infrastructure. 

* *Impediments*
Doesn’t know node.js, so he has to learn the new framework. However, he has experience with Django and know how to research more. To remove this impediment, Chun will be doing mob programming with the Development Team.

**Simon**
* *What did you do yesterday?*
Researched on the node.js framework and set up the framework on his machine

* *What are you gonna do today?*
Install new software and learn about the Node.js framework. Sit together with Mo to understand the infrastructure. 

* *Impediment*
Doesn’t know node.js, so he has to learn the new framework. To remove this impediment, Simon will research on the framework and do mob programming with the Development Team.

**General**
* *How do we remove impediments?*
The Development Team decided together with the Product Owner to break down the user stories into smaller items in order to lower the complexity and follow the INVEST principle.

11. **There is evidence that you are building your product test-first. There are at least 10 unit tests in your test suite, and they all pass.**
<br/>We conducted 10 unit tests which can be found in the test folder in the GitHub Repo for Crossroads. All tests passed.

**Feedback from Linh about functionality**
<br/>We demoed the Product Increment to Lihn and received the following feedback on the Product Increment:
* Knowing how to take the T 
* Recommendations for dinner
* Getting around campus - inside the buildings, how to find classrooms

* Refined User Story “Register User” by adding additional detail that for a user to be able to add blog posts one has to be a Harvard alumni.
* Adding a new PBI “Social Event Subsection” and estimated it to 13 story points
* Adding additional details to “Rating on Blog Posts”
